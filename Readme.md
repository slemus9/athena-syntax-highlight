# Athena Syntax Highlight support for VSCode

A very simple Syntax Highlighting support in vscode for [Athena](http://www.proofcentral.org/athena/).
An LSP support would also be great. But for now, this will help you to see some colors.

## How to install it locally
- Clone this repository into your vscode extensions folder. Usually located at: `$HOME/.vscode/extensions`. Restart your vscode.
- Open your file with vscode. It must have the `.ath` file extension in order for it to work.

I will try to gradually improve this and maybe develop a full language extension :D
